Docker in linux
=========================================
Virtualization:
--------------
	-It is a process of converting hardware resources to shared resource and distributing to multiple operating system (OS) to run . we install required software on top of it.
  	- it is done using a software called Hypervisor(bridge between OS and VM(Virtual Machine) that underlying the hardware)

(DOCKER IMAGE) My s/w = Appication [code] (.war /.jar ) + dependencies (JRE/Tomcat/MYSQL.. etc)

Containersation:
---------------
	Creating virtually isolated instances along with required dependencies called containers
	it is independent on OS and portable from one os to another
	bridge b/w containers and underlying OS

DOCKER:
-------
 It is a platform that provides Virtual Containers on which application can be deployed independent of underlying OS of server

 Image :  it is a packed s/w . application + dependencies

 Docker file : software details 
 develpoer and devops manager creates docker file
 Developer develops all the code . and developer creates a docker file.


 Code ------------->Docker File -----------> Image (Application (code)+dependencies) ------>Container(App running (instance))
 												Packed software

DockerHub : all the images are stored 												
=============================================================================
Virtualization: share h/w to multiple OS then install s/w and runs
Containerization: install s/w, run application --> independent on OS
Docker : Containersation platform
Docker file: Set of instructions (app details, dependency details ) to create Image
Docker Image : Docker understandable s/w( Dcokerfile --> build --> image)
Docker Container: Run Image (1 time/ multiple times) --> Running instance is called Container
Docker HUB: all the images are stored
